# Kotaib – Minimal Vue.js Bookstore Interface

Kotaib is a lightweight and responsive front-end application for a simple online bookstore, built using Vue 3. It provides a clean interface to browse books, manage a wishlist, and switch between the book catalog and saved items. This project serves as a solid starting point for learning Vue.js fundamentals, including conditional rendering, list rendering, and component interaction.

## Features

- Display a dynamic list of books with details including title, author, category, ISBN, and price
- Add and remove books from a wishlist
- Toggle between the book list and wishlist views
- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and Vue 3 (no build tools required)

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html        # Main HTML file with Vue integration
├── style.css         # Basic styling for layout and components
├── vue3.js           # Vue 3 runtime
├── books.js          # Static book data
├── /images           # Icons and illustrations
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Interact with the book list and wishlist via the navigation buttons

No build step or server is required — this project runs entirely in the browser.

## Technologies

- Vue.js 3 (CDN)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- SVG icons
